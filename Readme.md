##Shortregister OSEBX

This is a hobby project to explore the exiting(?) world of Java Spring Boot.  
The app provides daily updated data on companies that are shorted at Oslo BÃ¸rs by parsing an API from the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority.

The project is simple, basic and includes shortcuts here and there.  
It was created to learn the key concepts of the Spring framework, not to be a showcase for quality code.
